          "How do I choose the right program for my child's age, interests, and goals?",
        answer:
          "We help you take the guesswork out of learning. Our advisors guide families through a short consultation that identifies your child's strengths, personality, and future goals. Based on that, we recommend the best program match so students learn in a way that feels meaningful and motivating.",
